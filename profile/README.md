# The CAT-G Project

The Canadian Government has unveiled its "2030 Emissions Reduction Plan" that outlines a path for Canada to reach its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. This plan places significant importance on the agricultural sector, particularly livestock production, to help meet these targets. Our grand ambition is to store an additional 32.5 million metric tons of carbon in Canadian grasslands, which is valued at approximately $5.5 billion, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions from rangelands. To accomplish this, our project focuses on understanding how different grazing management (rotational vs. continuous grazing) affect soil carbon levels and greenhouse gas emissions, through their impact on soil and fecal microbiomes. This initiative aims to identify how microbial communities are linked to changes in greenhouse gas emissions. We will develop quick "bio-indicators" to facilitate climate-smart management actions and provide early indications of positive gains in soil carbon storage and reduced GHG emissions. This approach seeks to support carbon markets and innovative policies for emission reduction at various governmental levels, making Canada a global leader in sustainable grazing practices.
